# Bible Atlas — Design System & Development Rules

Every change to this project must follow these rules without exception.

---

## Project Context

Bible Atlas is a reading tool for Scripture with a cross-reference visualization as its navigation layer. On first load it opens directly to today's Gospel reading in the inline verse reader, with the visualization behind it filtered to today's lectionary books. A returning user who viewed a passage within the last 14 days is restored to that passage via a "Continue reading" chip.

Primary navigation is the **Cmd+K / `/` search palette** (`SearchPalette`), which parses book names, chapter/verse references (`john 3:16`, `mk4:1`), genres (`gospels`, `prophets`), and surfaces recent passages. The visualization views — **Arc** (default) and **Constellation** — are secondary entry points into the same drill-down.

Users can filter by:
- Canon: Catholic, Protestant, Ethiopian, Orthodox
- Translation: RSV-CE, JB, KJV (plus WEB, Douay-Rheims)
- Edge density (connection density threshold)

---

## Core Interaction Model

The visualization surfaces cross-reference structure; the `DetailPanel` is where reading happens. Opening a book drills from book → chapter → verse, and at the verse level `VerseReader` renders the full passage with margin dots that expose outbound cross-references. `ReadingPane` is a separate expanded view for liturgical readings (first reading, psalm, gospel, etc.) reached from `ReadingsPill`. Default state on first load is driven by the daily lectionary: today's Gospel opens in the reader, unless the user has either (a) a persisted last-passage within 14 days, or (b) dismissed today's readings, in which case `ReadingPlanCard` shows the M'Cheyne plan for the day.

## Typography

**Two fonts only. No exceptions.**

| Font | Usage |
|------|-------|
| **Cormorant Garamond** (fallback: EB Garamond) | All content text, headings, reading references, body copy |
| **JetBrains Mono** | All labels, data values, UI chrome, navigation items, counts, metadata |

- Import both from Google Fonts.
- No other fonts. No system fonts in any visible UI element.

---

## Color Palette

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Background | `#0a0a12` – `#12121f` range | Page background. Never pure black. |
| Primary accent | `#d4a04a` (warm amber) | Active states, title wordmark, key emphasis. Used sparingly. |
| Text primary | `#e8e0d0` (warm off-white) | Body text, headings |
| Text secondary | `#8a8a9a` (muted) | Supporting text, labels |
| Text dim | `#4a4a5a` (very muted) | Placeholders, disabled states |
| Glass panel bg | `rgba(20, 20, 40, 0.7)` | Floating panels, cards |
| Glass border | `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06)` | 1px border on glass elements |

Liturgical season colors are used **only** for the Today's Readings card border and season indicator dot.

---

## Interaction States

Every interactive element has exactly **three states**:

| State | Appearance |
|-------|-----------|
| **Rest** | Dim, receding, low opacity (40–50%) |
| **Hover** | Present, slightly brighter (70–80%), subtle transition |
| **Active** | Glowing, amber-tinted, full presence |

- All state changes use `transition: all 200ms ease-out`. No instant switches.

---

## Glass Morphism

All floating panels use dark glass — the visualization must be faintly visible through them.

```css
background: rgba(20, 20, 40, 0.7); /* alpha 0.7–0.85 */
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.06);
```

- No solid backgrounds on any overlapping elements.

---

## No Browser Defaults

Zero native form controls. Every input, slider, select, button, and toggle is custom-built.

> If it looks like it came from a browser stylesheet, rebuild it.

---

## Spacing

- Generous spacing everywhere. Padding is larger than feels necessary.
- Sacred content deserves breathing room.
- **Minimum 16px** padding on all interactive elements.
- **24px+** padding on cards.

---

## Tabs / View Order

1. **Arc view** — default view on page load
2. **Constellation view** — second tab

---

## Constraints

- **Do NOT modify the Arc visualization** — its rendering logic, data binding, and SVG generation must remain untouched. Only modify surrounding UI, text, popups, and controls. The files to leave untouched are `src/lib/arc-renderer.ts`, `src/lib/arc-shaders.ts`, and the core rendering logic in `src/components/ArcDiagram.tsx`.
- **Do NOT modify `src/lib/verse-index.ts`** — it builds a one-time global index over `arc-crossrefs.json` (≈500k entries) that `VerseReader`, `VerseMarginDot`, and `SearchPalette` all depend on. Changing its shape, keys, or cache lifecycle breaks reader navigation and verse popovers across the app.
- **Do NOT change the `PreferenceKey` schema in `src/lib/preferences.ts` without a migration.** The keys and value shapes are read from existing users' `localStorage` on every page load; renaming or repurposing keys silently wipes user state (last passage, dismissal streaks, recent-passages list, filter settings).
- The **Constellation view visualization will be rebuilt from scratch** in a separate prompt. Do not attempt to preserve its current rendering code.
- **Desktop-first.** Mobile responsiveness is secondary to desktop quality.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Framework | Next.js (App Router) | 16.1.6 |
| UI | React | 19.2.3 |
| Arc visualization | D3.js + WebGL shaders | 7.9.0 |
| Constellation visualization | Three.js | 0.183.2 |
| Panel / reader animations | motion (framer-motion successor) | 12.x |
| List virtualization | @tanstack/react-virtual | 3.x |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 + PostCSS | 4.x |
| Language | TypeScript (strict mode) | 5.9.3 |

## Developer Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start local dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run build    # Production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

There is no test suite. Verify changes by running `npm run build` — it catches TypeScript errors.

## Architecture Patterns

**State management:** All top-level state (view mode, selected book, canon, translation, edge density, active reading, drill state, persisted-restore chip) is lifted into `src/app/page.tsx` and passed down as props. There is no global state library.

**SSR disabled for visualizations:** Both `ArcDiagram` and `ForceGraph` are dynamically imported with `{ ssr: false }` because they use browser-only APIs (Canvas, WebGL, Three.js). Do the same for any new visualization components.

**CSS custom properties over Tailwind for design tokens:** Colors, fonts, spacing, and transitions are defined in `tokens.css` as CSS variables (e.g., `var(--accent)`, `var(--font-serif)`). Use these variables instead of hardcoding values or using Tailwind color utilities for design-system values.

**Data pipeline:** `edges.ts` (raw TSK cross-references) → `book-edges.json` (pre-aggregated book weights) → `arc-crossrefs.json` (full dataset for the arc renderer) → `public/crossrefs/{BOOK_ID}.json` (per-book files fetched lazily by `crossref-utils`). Do not modify the JSON files directly.

**Preference persistence:** All user settings and navigation restore state go through `src/lib/preferences.ts`, which wraps `localStorage` under a `bible-atlas-` namespace, guards every call against SSR (`typeof window`), and falls back to an in-memory `Map` on `QuotaExceededError`. Keys are enumerated as the `PreferenceKey` union — add new keys there and treat the existing set as a stable schema (see Constraints). Writes that can fire on every interaction (e.g. `last-book`/`last-chapter` as the user drills) are debounced in `page.tsx` before calling `setPreference`.

**Module-level caches:** Several lib files hold process-lifetime caches to avoid refetching or rebuilding expensive data: `verse-index.ts` lazily builds a single cross-reference index (`buildVerseIndex()` returns the same promise on every call); `crossref-utils.ts` caches per-book crossref JSON by `bookId`; `search-index.ts` caches palette verse-text previews (and `clearVerseTextCache()` is called when the active translation changes). Treat these caches as module state — reach for them through their exported functions rather than re-implementing fetches.

**One-shot navigation signals:** Imperative navigations into the reader (from search palette, cross-ref clicks, persisted restore, continue-reading chip) go through a `VerseNavigationRequest` (`src/lib/verse-navigation.ts`). Every request carries a fresh `key` (from `performance.now()`) so repeating a navigation to the same verse still retriggers the effect. `DetailPanel` consumes the signal and `VerseReader` plays the amber `.verse-pulse` outline on the target.

**Drill-down reducer:** `DetailPanel` uses `panelNavigationReducer` (`src/lib/panelNavigation.ts`) for book → chapter → verse state, history, and animation direction. Chapter swaps via the breadcrumb chevrons use `CHANGE_CHAPTER` (no history push); all other transitions push history and animate forward. `AnimatedPanelContent` consumes the animation direction to slide levels left or right.

**Data attributes as attachment points:** `VerseReader` renders each line with `data-verse={n}` so the pulse-on-navigate effect can `querySelector` the target without threading refs through every verse row. This is a localized pattern — don't introduce broader `data-*` selectors without a reason.

**Panel/reader animation:** Entrance/exit and drill-down transitions use the `motion` package (formerly framer-motion) via `motion/react`. `DetailPanel`, `ReadingPane`, and `AnimatedPanelContent` wrap their root in `AnimatePresence`; rely on that existing pattern instead of adding alternative animation libraries.

**SEO / metadata:** All marketing copy (`SITE_NAME`, `SITE_TITLE`, `SITE_DESCRIPTION`, keywords, theme color) is centralized in `src/lib/site-config.ts` and consumed by `layout.tsx`, the OG/Twitter image routes, `manifest.ts`, `sitemap.ts`, and `robots.ts`. Update copy there rather than in individual route files.

## Styling Conventions

- Use CSS variables from `tokens.css` for all design-system values.
- The `.glass-panel` utility class (defined in `globals.css`) applies the standard glass morphism styles. Use it instead of repeating the CSS.
- The `.three-state-interactive` utility class applies the standard rest/hover/active opacity pattern.
- Tailwind utilities are acceptable for layout (flex, grid, positioning) but not for color or typography — use CSS variables for those.
